          Why Boutique Hotels Are Becoming More Popular
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-[15px] leading-relaxed">
          The shift toward boutique hotels reflects a broader movement in the travel world:  
          a desire for experiences that feel human, personalized, and meaningful.  
          Unlike large traditional hotels, boutique stays often incorporate local art,  
          chef-driven dining, community-inspired activities, and interior design that tells a story.  
          It’s this sense of individuality and warmth that continues to win the hearts of modern travelers.
