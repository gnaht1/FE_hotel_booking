# 1. Project Overview
**Context:**
The hospitality industry faces a disconnect between travelers struggling with fragmented booking systems and hotel owners lacking real-time management tools .

**Solution:**
**JMM Booking** bridges this gap by providing:
1.  **For Travelers:** A seamless, unified platform to search, view, and book hotels instantly .
2.  **For Hotel Owners:** A comprehensive dashboard to manage inventory, track revenue, and oversee bookings in real-time.

# 4. Implementation Process
## 4.1. Plan & Design
Defined user roles (Traveler/Owner) and mapped out core functionalities including Search, Booking Flow, and Property Management.


## 4.2. Database Design
Designed a **MongoDB** schema to handle flexible data relationships :

- Users: Authentication and profile data.

- Hotels & Rooms: Store details, amenities, prices, and owner references.

- Bookings: Link users to rooms with transaction status.

## 4.3. API Development & Documentation
Built **RESTful APIs** using **Express.js** with clear CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) .

Integrated **Swagger** to auto-generate documentation, allowing the Frontend team to test endpoints directly without needing backend code access .

## 4.4. Third-Party Integrations
Leveraged specialized services to ensure security and scalability :

- **Clerk**: Secure authentication and session management.

- **Stripe**: Global payment gateway for PCI-compliant transactions.

- **Cloudinary**: Optimized image storage for hotel galleries.

- **Brevo**: Automated transactional emails for booking confirmations.

## 4.5. Deployment Infrastructure

- **AWS EC2**: Deployed the application on an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instance.

- **Nginx** Configuration: Configured to serve the React build at root (/) and proxy /api requests to localhost:3000.

- Domain: Connected custom domain via **Namecheap** with **Cloudflare** nameservers .
